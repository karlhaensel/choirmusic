## Good to know
I am a professional choir director and singer from Northern Germany. Therefore, the present editions are practical editions that make no musicological claim. I would be grateful for any information about errors or suggestions for improvement. Questions or requests for transposed versions are also welcome. However, this is only a leisure project, so I cannot promise a quick response. Feel free to use the Lilypond code for your own editions.

## Content
A loose collection of practical sheet music editions for choirs and singers containing:
- editions, I already used in performances with my choirs
- editions of pieces, I used to performe with other editions that had some minor or major flaws
- editions of pieces, I want to study with my choirs in the future
- editions, I just made for fun and/or to improve my Lilypond skills
