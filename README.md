# Choir music
## Good to know
I am a professional choral conductor and singer from Northern Germany. Therefore, the present editions are practical editions with no musicological claim. I would be grateful for any information about errors or suggestions for improvement. Questions or requests for transposed versions are also welcome via [e-mail](mailto:Karl-Haensel@gmx.de). However, I cannot promise a quick reply, as this is only a hobby project. Feel free to use the Lilypond code for your own editions.

## Content
A loose collection of practical editions for choirs and singers, including
- editions that I have used in performances with my choirs
- editions of pieces that I have performed with other editions that had some minor or major flaws
- editions of pieces that I would like to study with my choirs in the future
- editions I have made just for fun and/or to improve my Lilypond skills

## How to get PDF or MIDI files
For security reasons, PDF and MIDI files are not uploaded directly to the repository. However, you may find a current version of the PDF and MIDI files within a zip file in the latest release (see right column of repository homepage). Furthermore, [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) (the markup language these scores are written in) and [Frescobaldi](https://www.frescobaldi.org/) (a very handy Lilypond editor) are available online for free. Even if you do not know Lilypond, you can compile your own PDF files with Frescobaldi once you have installed Lilypond.

## Have fun with this (and other) choral music!
